2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features for better analysis.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** Examination of relationships between factors and capital at risk using statistical tests.
5. **Modeling and Insights:** Development of regression models to understand influencing factors and evaluation of model performance.
6. **Reporting and Visualization:** Presentation of findings through detailed reports and visualizations.
